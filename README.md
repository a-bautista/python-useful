Python
======
The code from this repo is not part of any project but just the assignments from my computer 
security course from my university. I advice that the code in python is not so well polished,
that is, there are still some exceptions that I need to add and optimize some parts of my code.
I just learnt to program in python few weeks ago so I am still learning.
